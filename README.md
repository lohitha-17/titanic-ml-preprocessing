# Titanic Dataset - Data Preprocessing and Visualization

This project explores the **Titanic dataset** from Kaggle with a focus on **data preprocessing**, **exploratory data analysis (EDA)**, and **visualization** to uncover patterns and insights related to passenger survival.

## ðŸ“Œ Objectives

- Perform data cleaning and preprocessing
- Handle missing values and convert categorical variables
- Conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Visualize key patterns and survival trends

## ðŸ“‚ Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the classic [Titanic Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic/data), containing details of passengers aboard the Titanic, such as age, gender, class, and survival status.

## ðŸ§° Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Google Colab

## ðŸ“Š Key Highlights

- Cleaned and processed missing data fields (e.g., Age, Cabin, Embarked)
- Applied label encoding to convert categorical variables
- Created multiple visualizations to analyze:
  - Survival by gender
  - Survival by class
  - Age distribution among survivors and non-survivors
  - Heatmaps for correlation
- Prepared the data for future model building

## ðŸ“ˆ Sample Visuals

Here are some visualizations from the analysis:

- Bar plots for gender/class-based survival
- Heatmap for feature correlations
- Distribution plots for age and fare

## ðŸš€ Future Work

- Train machine learning models to predict survival
- Apply feature engineering and hyperparameter tuning
- Evaluate model performance using classification metrics
